## Vic's TextMate Config!

This is just my personal TextMate config.

It consists of Plugins, Themes, Bundles and customisations to Bundles.

Sure, I could [use DropBox to sync](http://farukat.es/journal/2009/01/140-syncing-your-textmate-bundles-across-multiple-macs-with-dropbox), but doing it this way allows me to:

1. Learn the basics of git!
2. [Use submodules to manage Bundles](http://code.nevercraft.net/posts/2010/06/14/managing-textmate-bundles-with-git-submodules.html), linking them to their own repos so I can update them from their source
3. Roll out my config quick-and-easy over another machine

More words soon!
